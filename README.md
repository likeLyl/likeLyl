- 👋 Hi, I’m @likeLyl
- 👀 I’m interested in Robotics, especially quadruped robots, 
- 🌱 I’m currently researching on central pattern generator (CPG) and robot spine.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on combining reinforcement learning with CPG and applied it to generate adaptive gaits for quadruped robots
- 📫 If you'd like to talk about any questions about CPG and RL in the robotics field, just send email to yunlong.lian95@gmail.com
